# HABMS

This app is currently hosted at [https://kolefn.github.io/HABMS/](https://kolefn.github.io/HABMS/).

#Notice 
- The weather feature will not work unless you provide a CREDENTIALS.DARK_SKY_API_KEY global var. 

#Issues 
- The simulator throws [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) errors. Using a [plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) for chrome will allow the simulation to work. However, that is not really recommended. I will hopefully find a solution to this at some point.
